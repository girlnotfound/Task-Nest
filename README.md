# Task-Nest

## Task Nest is an application designed to help users effectively organize and track multiple tasks within a project.

- This intuitive site allows users to add tasks, manage their progression, and visually monitor their tasks progress. Task Nest is useful to anyone aiming to efficiently organize their schedules and tasks.

## User Interface

- Users can interact with the task board in several ways to manage their tasks effectively.

- By clicking the "Add Task" button, users can enter details like title, description and deadline into a modal dialog.

- Clicking the "Save" button will store the task in the browser's localStorage, ensuring no data is lost even when the browser is closed or refreshed.

- Users can drag tasks between columns to update their progress. Changes are automatically saved and will persist across sessions.

- Tasks can be permanently removed from the task board by clicking the "Delete" button on any task.

**Tasks are organized on a task board, which is divided into columns that represent different stages of task progress:**

- To Do: tasks that have been identified but not yet begun.

- In Progress: tasks that are currently being worked on.

- Completed: tasks that have been finished.

**To help users assess the urgency of their tasks, the application uses color coding**

- Yellow: indicates a task is nearing its deadline.

- Red: indicates a task is overdue.

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS for structuring and styling.

- JavaScript for the interactive elements and managing localStorage.

- Bootstrap to improve user engagement and simplify the process of entering tasks.

- jQuery UI to help with the drag and drop feature, allowing users to easily move tasks on the board.
